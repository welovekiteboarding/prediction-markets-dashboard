*Research Date: December 25, 2025*

## 1. BEGINNER-FRIENDLY EDGES (Zero Technical Skills Required)

### A. Wisdom of the Crowd & Simple Trend Following
- **Price = Probability Core Concept**: If market says $0.70 (70%), but you believe it's 85%, buy
- **Follow High-Volume Markets**: Stick to markets with high volume and clear open interest
- **The 2% Rule**: Never allocate more than 2% of total capital to single position
- **Source**: HobbyJoy Beginner's Guide

### B. Personal Expertise & Local Knowledge
- **Start with What You Know**: If you understand economics, trade CPI/Fed markets. If you follow F1, trade racing
- **Filter Noise vs Signal**: Viral tweets (noise) vs reliable polls/data (signal)
- **Your Existing Knowledge is Your Initial Advantage**: Better than general crowd
- **Real Example**: Economics student noticed rising inflation data + Fed speeches → bet on rate hikes when market priced it at 30% but real probability was 60%

### C. Contrarian Approaches (Betting Against Consensus)
- **Not Blindly Fading Public**: Use as corroborating data, not strategy itself
- **Look for "Ugly" Games**: Unpopular events that offer value opportunities
- **Identify Extreme Sentiment**: When market consensus becomes too one-sided
- **Find Value When Odds Don't Reflect True Probability**
- **Sources**: Underdog Chance, Pinnacle Odds Dropper, various betting strategy sites

### D. Time-Based Arbitrage (Early vs Late Betting)
- **Early Betting Advantages**:
  - Beat the closing line value (CLV)
  - Early odds are "softer" and more vulnerable
  - Sharps bet early to exploit initial odds
  - Monday strategy for favorites
- **Late Betting Advantages**:
  - Sunday strategy for underdogs
  - Maximum information (injuries, weather, etc.)
- **Real-World Example**: Movie box office market - negative reviews caused price to drop from $0.85 to $0.65, but box office enthusiast knew director was "critic-proof" and bought at panic price

### E. Understanding Market Psychology (The Real Edge)
- **Reddit Success Story ($40k Profit)**: 
  > "Market inefficiency usually comes from liquidity and incentives rather than lack of information. When a certain type of bettor dominates a market, the odds tend to drift toward emotional rather than rational values."
  > "The real advantage often comes from predicting how other participants will behave, not just from predicting the event itself."

## 2. RISK MANAGEMENT FOR BEGINNERS

### Bankroll Management Basics
- **Treat as Entertainment Budget**: Money you're 100% prepared to lose
- **2% Rule**: Maximum 2% of total capital per position
- **Start Small**: $20-50 recommended to test
- **Use Platform Safety Tools**: Trading breaks, personalized funding caps

### Understanding Variance
- **Higher Odds = More Variance**: Low-probability bets create bigger swings
- **Diversify Across Markets**: Don't concentrate all risk
- **Position Sizing**: 1% of bankroll as unit size for beginners

### When to Cash Out
- **Never Let Winner Turn to Loser**: If bought at $0.30 and price hits $0.75 (up 150%), sell early to lock in profit
- **Protect from Unforeseen Events**: Early selling guarantees profit vs. waiting for resolution

### Understanding Fees
- **Always Factor in Fees**: 3-5% platform fees reduce effective profit
- **Example Calculation**: Must ensure trade is profitable AFTER costs
- **Polymarket Fees**: 2% on buys/sells (1% platform, 1% liquidity providers)

## 3. PSYCHOLOGICAL EDGES

### Avoiding Emotional Trading
- **The "Hope Bet" Trap**: Don't confuse what you WANT to happen with what's LIKELY to happen
- **Avoid Markets You're Emotionally Invested In**: Personal bias is the biggest enemy
- **Chasing the Hype**: Heavily discussed events are already highly efficient

### Understanding Cognitive Biases
- **Confirmation Bias**: Seeking information that supports existing beliefs
- **Overconfidence**: Overestimating your knowledge
- **Loss Aversion**: Holding losing positions too long
- **Recency Bias**: Overweighting recent events
- **Sources**: Investopedia, AvaTrade, academic papers on cognitive bias dynamics

### Patience and Discipline
- **Watch Markets First**: Don't trade immediately - observe patterns
- **Stick to Your Strategy**: Every bet tests your epistemology
- **Learn from Losses**: Markets give instant feedback on calibration

### Liquidity Awareness
- **Illiquid Markets Risk**: Easy to buy, hard to sell at good price
- **Stick to High-Volume Markets**: As beginner, avoid niche/new markets
- **Real Example**: Thin liquidity makes prediction markets behave "more like poker games than pure information markets"
