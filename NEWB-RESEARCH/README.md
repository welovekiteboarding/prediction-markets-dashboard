## How to Explain Prediction Markets (Simply)

### Most Effective Analogies

1. **"Stock Market for Events"** (Most Common)
   - Instead of trading company shares, you trade outcomes
   - Buy "Yes" or "No" shares in future events

2. **"Wisdom of Crowds"**
   - Like asking a crowd to guess jelly beans in a jar
   - Average guess is often surprisingly accurate

3. **"Betting on the Weather"**
   - If many people bet on rain, the "price" goes up
   - Price reflects perceived probability

### Price as Probability (Core Concept)

- $0.65 = 65% chance of happening
- $0.10 = 10% chance (very unlikely)
- If you think real probability is HIGHER than price, buy "Yes"
- If you think real probability is LOWER than price, buy "No"

### Binary Options Explained

- Contracts pay $1 if correct, $0 if wrong
- Buy at $0.65 → if correct, profit = $0.35 ($1.00 - $0.65)
- Maximum loss = purchase price (can't lose more than you invest)

## Common Beginner Questions

### "Is this gambling?"

**Answer**: It's informed speculation, not casino gambling.

| Prediction Markets | Betting Markets |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Trade against other traders | Trade against the house |
| Market-driven odds | House sets odds with margin |
| Price discovery focus | Entertainment focus |

### "How do I make money?"

1. Buy low, sell high (like stocks)
2. Hold until resolution (event happens)
3. Start with $20-50 to learn
4. Research events before trading

### "Can I lose more than I invest?"

**No**. Maximum loss = what you paid for shares. Binary options have capped risk ($0 or $1).
